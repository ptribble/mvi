Drivers: pcn, e1000g, vioif are what you see in VMs

TRIBsys-kernel-platform

TRIBdrv-i86pc-platform - has useful things like cmdk, asy

TRIBsys-zones - contains libraries that might be needed by common
utilities

TRIBshell-ksh93 - is a separate package in recent releases, and we do
need a shell

TRIBsys-boot-loader - needed as part of the ISO construction and boot

consconfig_dacf needs usbser, so can't remove TRIBdrv-ser-usbser

If you don't install zfs, the system will panic if you do a 'find /'
(I think once it walks into /dev)

TRIBsys-boot-real-mode - system panics if it's not present


virtualbox - network is e1000g, storage is ahci

qemu - network is e1000g, storage is cmdk

vmware - network is e1000g, storage is mpt

mpt is in TRIBsys-kernel
cmdk is in TRIBdrv-i86pc-platform
ahci is in TRIBdrv-storage-ahci

So don't need pcn at all


Standard build at this point is a 144M (122M used) image that creates a 56M iso

Unfortunately, strip doesn't work, in general
