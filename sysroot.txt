You could also use mvi to generate a sysroot, like

https://github.com/illumos/sysroot

All that basically contains is the files from

system/header = TRIBsys-header
system/library = TRIBsys-library
system/library/math = TRIBsys-lib-math
system/library/c-runtime = TRIBsys-lib-c-runtime

Note that *this* sysroot generation doesn't include the gcc shims.

To do this, with the illumos packages in the normal places under
$THOME, without needing to be root, run a command like so

./sysroot.sh -u -v 38

The -u uses zapadd rather than pkgadd so it can run as an unprivileged
user, and the -v specifies the version. Note that the ownership will
be incorrect, but that's fine for the intended use case.

This will generate an output file containing the tarred up sysroot:

/var/tmp/sysroot.38.tar.gz
