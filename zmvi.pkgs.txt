What provides the minimal baseline for a zone?

SUNWcsd
 - there's a minimal number of device entries you need for a system to
 function

SUNWcs
 - common userland

TRIBsys-library
 - everything uses shared libraries, even Go

TRIBshell-ksh93
 - ksh is now a separate package

TRIBsys-net
 - if we ever did want networking in a zone, would supply dladm and
 friends
